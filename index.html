            <h2>About us</h2>
            <p>A single-story building made of sandstone, the cantina consisted of a bar area, private offices, a VIP lounge, a private hangar, a basement, and a phony shop in the rear. With a maximum occupancy of 102 humanoids, the facility catered to all sorts from across the galaxy, with spacious areas and wide arched doorways to allow patrons of all sizes passage.</p>

            <p>Entering through a small portal on one side of the building, a small passage curved around into the main bar area. The bar, featuring many themed spigots which resembled the head of an IG-series assassin droid, was capable of producing several dozen drinks of Chalmun's concocting. Surrounded by eight different alcoves filled with stools, tables, and even a bandstand, the bar wrapped from the public area around into the more private back room. Outside of public view, several secret rooms existed to house sleeping areas for fugitives fleeing the law. At the very back of the building, an open-air hangar housed Chalmun's private shuttle which could be used routinely to transport liquor, or for escape.</p>

            <p>Inside one of the building's domed portions, Chalmun kept his offices. Including his own private bar, the Wookiee's office space was home to his security chief and several confiscated weapons. The back rooms of the building ran parallel to the outside bazaar, which sold droid parts and scrap metal. Chalmun maintained a shop out back that sold clothes and other goods. Its domed roof sported a communications jammer disguised as a vaporator.</p>

            <p>Underneath the cantina, a small cellar had been built long before Chalmun came to Tatooine. The bartender, Wuher, used the basement to cook up new brews for his clients; previous owners had used it as a catacomb.</p>
